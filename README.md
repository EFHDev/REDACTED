Depending on the type of ammo/arrow it can inflict other types of damage, such as octotoxin, or blood toxicity if not treated correctly after

## Ammo types

### Bullets

**Keywords:**

- **Deform:** Can deform resulting in take-down damage causing less loot from the animal, or damaged/destroyed gear from the player killed.
- **Shrapnel:** Chance to turn into shrapnel when exiting barrel, causing a shotgun effect, and damaging the pistol. If the durability goes under 0 during this effect, the pistol will explode, damaging you, and destroying the pistol. This can be done intentionally by making shrapnel rounds (See below)

### Tin Bullet

- **Pros:**
  - Easy extruding, Can be melted on a campfire
  - Pretty common, can be made from tin cans, from canned foods, or from solder spools for a 50/50 tin/lead bullet
- **Cons:**
  - Very weak, in comparison to other bullets
  - Shrapnel possibility (See Shrapnel Ammo Type)
  - Can deform

### Copper Bullet

- **Pros:**
  - Durable
  - Easy extruding, requires charcoal in a campfire & a crucible
- **Cons:**
  - Requires charcoal
  - Time-consuming to heat up
  - Mediocre Damage
  - Can deform resulting in take-down damage resulting in less loot from the animal, or damaged/destroyed gear from the player killed.

### Lead Bullet

- **Pros:**
  - High damage
  - Can be made from lead pipes, or lead weights
  - Causes ototoxicity sickness
- **Cons:**
  - Requires a furnace to melt
  - Toxic fumes when producing
  - Can deform resulting in take-down damage resulting in less loot from the animal, or damaged/destroyed gear from the player killed.

### Gold Bullet

- **Pros:**
  - Heavy damage due to its density
  - Easily formed
  - Shrapnel possibility (See Shrapnel Ammo Type) 5%
  - I wish for everything I touch to be turned to gold!
- **Cons:**
  - Very expensive
  - Extremely Low penetration due to softness

### Shrapnel Bullet

- **Pros:**
    - Shotgun effect
    - High bleed and slash damage, will cause permanent damage to players hit by these
- **Cons:**
    - Damages pistol
        - If the pistols durability goes _below_ 0 during this effect, the pistol explodes possibly hurting you horribly
    - Very short range
    - Very low penetration
  ## Equipment 

### Respirator
Stops infectious or toxic gas from harming you/infecting you (Toxic gas's from production, Lurker Spores, smoke, etc)
- Has limited use, once used up fully, will only reduce the chance of infection by 10%
- Filters can be replaced by shift clicking on a filter while a mask is equipped, or shift-clicking with the filter in your off-hand with the resperrator in the main hand. During this process your chance of infection is 2% for 3 seconds while the filter "changes"

### Watch
Lets you know when your respirator's filter is about to run out, May be included with the resperator, i dont know yet, however it will show as a UI element,

# Sickness
SIckness is a system designed around protecting yourself from environmental factors such as Lurker Spores, smoke, or man made dangers such as toxic gas from producing certin items (Maybe more)


## Lurker Sickness
Ha you thought i would give away the big idea? Go back to bed gutin 

## Ototoxicity
Can be caused by getting impalded, slashed, shot, or allowing your charcter to sit in a area with high amounts of lead fumes, from production or gas grenades (maybe) Obviously the latter is much more likely due to it being directly put into your charcters "blood" (being damaged by it)
## Improved Food System

**Shown in the format of its raw variant -> what it cooks into**

### Dynamic Meat System

Ultima Hora's food system is unique in that it uses a single item with various data components to represent different types of meat. These components include the animal's type, tameness, and method of killing, allowing for dynamic stats. This system also extends to vanilla meats.

The wildcard symbol (?) indicates that the meat can have multiple names (e.g., Llama, Horse, Cat, Wolf, Tuna).

### Meat Types

* **Raw ?** -> **Cooked Common Fish** (Fish)
* **Raw ? Meat** -> **Cooked Red Meat** (Animal)
* **Raw ? Meat** -> **Cooked Bush Meat** (Animal/Aquatic) (*This includes meat that would be white meat IRL)
* **Raw ? Meat** -> **Cooked Unethical Meat** (Domesticated/Domesticable/Working animal)

### Food Items

* **Raw Red Meat**
* **Cooked Red Meat**

* **Raw Bush Meat**
* **Cooked Bush Meat**

* **Raw Tuna**
* **Cooked Common Fish**
